# Analyzing Bureau of Labor Statistics Data with Machine Learning

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is a United States government agency that collects and publishes data on labor market activity,
including employment, unemployment, and wages. The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to analyze BLS data
and gain insights into trends in job growth.

## Neural Network Architecture

The program defines a simple neural network architecture with three fully connected layers.

## Data Preprocessing

The program loads a sample dataset of BLS data, which includes variables such as unemployment rate, inflation rate, labor force participation rate, and median weekly earnings.

## Training the Neural Network

The neural network is trained on the BLS data using binary cross-entropy loss and stochastic gradient descent optimization.

## Evaluating Performance

The trained network is used to make predictions on new BLS data. The program also includes a visualization component that plots the training loss over time to evaluate the performance of the neural network.
